  library    projects, sections, and the sidebar lists
  migrate    the one-time switch from JSON documents to Markdown
  history    version history and the Trash
  documents  routes for documents and folders
  projects   routes for projects
  ai         the labeled AI request, OpenRouter, Ollama
  models     the model list and OpenRouter's price list
